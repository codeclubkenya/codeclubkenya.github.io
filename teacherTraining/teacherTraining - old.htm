      <h3 id="about">About</h3>

      <p> At Code Club we think everyone should have the opportunity to experience the joy of computer science. It's our mission in life to make that opportunity available to everyone whether that's through school clubs or teacher training sessions like these.</p>

<p>Our goal is to improve access to training, so that teachers can feel confident and excited about delivering the computing curriculum. So not only will you benefit from our training, you will be supporting a really great and much needed grassroots organisation, even if we do say so ourselves.Training takes not more than one week. If you would like to be trained to become a teacher of coding or volunteer at primary school, please contact us at codeclubke@gmail.com</p>

      <h3 id="modules">Modules</h3>

      <p>Our modules are aimed at: (1) Teachers who want a comprehensive understanding of the computing curriculum; (2) Headteachers who want a summary of the main themes of the curriculum; (3) Other persons interested in learning about coding or computer programming.</p>

      <p><strong>Module 1: Demystifying the teaching of computer programming at primary schools</strong><br>
      This introductory session looks in detail at the new program of study. We demystify technical language used and explain core concepts such as algorithms and computational thinking.</p><br>

      <p><strong>Module 2: Computing for lower primary</strong><br>
      In this session, we look at organising, sorting, predicting, debugging, decomposition and abstraction, as well as a little programming using floor turtles and Scratch. The learning outcomes include:</p>

<ul style="padding-left:20px">
 <li>Understand what algorithms are and how they are used in computing.</li>
<li>Feel confident with technical language and concepts such as organising, sorting, predicting, debugging, decomposition and abstraction (including how these can be embedded across the curriculum).</li>
<li>Create, debug and use logical reasoning to predict the behaviour of simple programs (such as floor turtles). </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Module 3: Programming for upper primary</strong><br>
      In this session, we start programming using Scratch. We look at decomposition, debugging and iterative development, as well as cross-curricular coding activities.</p><br>	


      <h3 id="become-a-trainer">Become A Trainer</h3>

      <p><strong>What we offer</strong><br></p>
     
<ul style="padding-left:20px">
 <li>Become a black-belt trainer and presenter with our professional development training course</li>
 <li>Get a very shiny halo. You are helping to change the country for the better!</li>
 <li>Expand your network</li>
 <li>We'll provide all session materials and everything you need to deliver engaging training and you'll get full support from our team</li>
	</ul>

<p><strong>What will be required of me as a Code Club Kenya trainer?</strong><br></p>

<p>You will be required to deliver a minimum of four training sessions to primary school teachers every year. This will normally be in a school near you, however, if you are up for it we will also ask you to run training sessions out of a school setting.

Our sessions cover the language, concepts and objectives of the new Computing Curriculum. You won't be teaching teachers how to teach - they are the experts on the that front. You will be sharing your CS expertise. We see this as a starting point to give teachers the confidence to begin teaching computing, with a firm grounding in the subject. </p>

<p><strong>Do I need to have any expertise to become a Trainer?</strong><br></p>


<p>We are looking for people with programming skills and an understanding of core computer science concepts.</p>

<p><strong>How will I benefit?</strong><br></p>

<ul style="padding-left:20px">

<li>Transferable skills. Our training has been developed with leading experts in training delivery, is accredited by CAS and supported by Google. You will gain a solid grounding in both the psychology and practice of training delivery.

<li>Experience. Train a room full of teacher's, gain exposure to the education sector, and join a network of nationwide professionals working to help our teachers.

<li>Feel good. There is a nationwide skills gap and industry are stepping forward to help our teaches. You are literally changing the lives of primary school teachers, and therefore primary school children. </ul>
