      <p><strong>What is Code Club Kenya?</strong><br>
        Code Club is just getting started in Kenya right now.  If you wish to get involved, or are ready to get going and want to register a new club please use the <a href="../contact/contact-us.htm">Contact Us</a> form so we can support you in your journey.</p>

      Code Club Kenya is a network of free volunteer-led school coding clubs for primary school pupils.</p>
      <p>We create projects for our volunteers to teach at school coding clubs or at non-school venues such as libraries. The projects we make teach children how to program by showing them how to make computer games, animations and websites. Our volunteers go to their local club for an hour a week and teach one project a week.</p>
      <p>We write a new set of projects every term. Each term the students will progress and learn more whilst at the same time using their imaginations and making creative projects. Terms 1 &amp; 2 will use Scratch to teach the basics of programming. Term 3 will teach the basics of web development using HTML and CSS. Term 4 will teach Python and so on.</p>

      <p><strong>How does it work?</strong><br>
      <p>Anybody who is interested in participating - be it a volunteer, school or other venue - should get in touch using the <a href="../contact/contact-us.htm">Contact Us</a> form. When a volunteer and venue have been secured, the volunteer needs to complete a short checklist in order to activate their club.</p> 
      <p>Once this has been completed, the volunteer can download all our projects and materials and get going!</p>
      <!-- Firstly, schools that want a Code Club register on our website as a <a href="/start-a-club/venues/venues.html">venue looking for a volunteer</a>.</p>
      <p>Likewise, if someone wants to volunteer to run a club, they simply <a href="/start-a-club/volunteers/volunteers.html">register</a> and search for a venue.</p>
      <p>The volunteer and the school talk to each other, meet up and agree on a day and time to run the club. The volunteer will need to complete a short checklist in order to activate the club.</p>
      <p>Once this is done, the volunteer can then download all our projects and materials and get going!</p> -->

      <p><strong>Can I see the materials you teach?</strong><br>
      You can access some of the materials on the <a href="https://github.com/CodeClub">Code Club Github page</a>.</p>
      <p>Once you have a registered club, we'll send you more information on how to use these materials.</p>

      <p><strong>Can I charge for Code Club?</strong><br>
      In short - no. Not charging for Code Club is one of our core tenets, and we make all of our materials and resources available for free and our volunteers give their time for free. We do not allow clubs to charge for attendance as it goes again the ethos of the organisation.</p>

     <!--  <p><strong>Where can I get support?</strong><br>
      Check out our <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/forum/codeclub-hk">Google Group</a> forum to get in touch with volunteers. It might be that there's already an answer to your question there. It’s also a good way to get in touch and talk to other volunteers about their experiences.</p>
      <p>For any other questions you can <a href="mailto:support@codeclubhk.org">email us</a> and we&#39;ll be happy to answer your questions.</p> -->

      <p><strong>Can I donate to Code Club?</strong><br>
      Yes! We rely heavily on donations to continue growing and being able to teach as many children to code. You can donate to us online <a href="../support-us/support-us.htm">here</a>.</p>

      <p><strong>Are you a charity?</strong><br>
      We are a not-for-profit organisation. This means that although we are not a charity, any money that Code Club makes goes straight back into our work and operations. </p>

      <p><strong>Where are you based?</strong><br>
      <a href="http://www.codeclub.org.uk">Code Club</a> is a small team based in London. Code Club Kenya is a network of volunteers based throughout Kenya.</p>

      <p><strong>Can my company sponsor Code Club?</strong><br>
      Absolutely! If you are a company interested in sponsoring us, please <a href="../contact/contact-us.htm">get in touch</a> </p>

      <p><strong>I&#39;m from the press, can I have an interview about Code Club?</strong><br>
      Of course! Please <a href="../contact/contact-us.htm">Contact Us</a> to say hello.</p>

      <p><strong>What are the terms of service?</strong><br>
      You can read our Terms of Service <a href="http://codeclub-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CodeClubWorld-Terms-of-Service-v1-clean.pdf">here</a>.</p>

      <h3 id="for-volunteers">For Volunteers</h3>

      <p>Full information for volunteers can be found <a href="../start-a-club/volunteers/volunteers.htm">here</a></p>

      <p><strong>What do I need to know to be able to run a Code Club?</strong><br>
      The main thing a good Code Club volunteer should have is enthusiasm. We don&#39;t ask for any formal qualification or evidence of your coding ability. </p>
      <p>Our projects start off using Scratch, before moving on to simply HTML/CSS and Python. We recommend a basic knowledge of these. However, we tend to say that if you can work through the materials yourself then you can teach it to school children. You can view some sample materials of our projects <a href="../codeclub/about.htm">here</a>.</p>

      <p><strong>How do I volunteer?</strong><br>
      First, read through the information on our <a href="../start-a-club/volunteers/volunteers.htm">volunteers page</a>. When you're ready, click "Search for a venue" and follow the steps to sign up and look for a venue to volunteer at.</p>
      <p>Once you&#39;ve found a venue, you&#39;ll be taken through a checklist of things you need to do to activate your club. This will include meeting with the school and arranging a time and date to run the club. After this is done, your club will be activated and you&#39;ll be all set!</p>

      <p><strong>Can I see the materials before signing up?</strong><br>
      You can see a sample of materials <a href="../codeclub/about.htm">here</a>. You will get full access to resources once your registration is complete and your club has been activated.</p>
      <p>You can access some of the materials on the <a href="https://github.com/CodeClub">Code Club Github page</a>.</p>
      <p>Once you have a <a href="../start-a-club/start-a-club.htm">registered club</a>, we'll send you more information on how to use these materials.</p>

      <p><strong>Where do I get the materials from?</strong><br>
      <p>Once you have a <a href="../start-a-club/start-a-club.htm">registered a club</a>, we'll send you everything you need.</p>

      <p><strong>Can you put me in touch with a school?</strong><br>
      It&#39;s up to you to approach a school if you&#39;re interested in volunteering, but we do have some advice available on our site <a href="../start-a-club/volunteers/volunteers.html">here</a>, including ways of emailing the school to make contact.</p>

      <!-- <p><strong>I can’t find a school nearby. What should I do?</strong><br>
      It could be that they haven’t heard of Code Club yet. You can contact them to let them know about it via the <a href="/search-for-a-venue">search</a> function on our website.</p> -->

      <p><strong>How long are lessons?</strong><br>
      Code Club sessions are intended to last about an hour and happen once per week, and designed to fit in with the school term. However, it&#39;s certainly no problem to us if the club starts after half term, or in January, or whenever! Each club works at its own speed, depending on the children's progress. If you'd rather run a club for half an hour at lunchtime, then go for it!</p>

      <!-- <p><strong>Can I run a club at more than one school?</strong><br>
      Absolutely! You&#39;ll need to make sure your status is set to &quot;Looking to Volunteer&quot; in your account so that other schools can still find you.</p> -->

      <p><strong>Will you be updating the materials for Scratch 2.0?</strong><br>
      Terms 1 and 2 are designed to be used using Scratch 1.4. At present we are in the process of creating a set of materials that uses Scratch 2.0. We&#39;ll blog and tweet when it&#39;s ready.</p>

      <h3 id="for-venues">For Venues</h3>

      <p>Full information for venues can be found <a href="../start-a-club/venues/venues.htm">here</a></p>

      <p><strong>How do I register my venue to run a Code Club?</strong><br>
        Code Club is just getting started in Kenya right now.  If you wish to get involved, or are ready to get going and want to register a new club please use the <a href="../contact/contact-us.htm">Contact Us</a> form so we can support you in your journey.</p>
     <!--  You can register your venue <a href="../start-a-club/venues/venues.htm">here</a>. Simply enter your address and select whether you are school or other public venue. Once this is done, volunteers in your area will be able to find your venue on our website’s search and get in touch with you.</p> -->

      <p><strong>Can I see the materials before signing up?</strong><br>
      You can see a sample of materials <a href="../codeclub/about.htm">here</a>. You will get full access to resources once your registration is complete and your club has been activated.</p>
      <p>You can access some of the materials on the <a href="https://github.com/CodeClub">Code Club Github page</a>.</p>
      <p>Once you have a <a href="../start-a-club/start-a-club.htm">registered a club</a>, we'll send you more information on how to use these materials.</p>

    <!--   <p><strong>I home school my children. Can I set up a club?</strong><br>
      Absolutely! When registering your venue, be sure to select &#39;Home School&#39; in the drop-down menu.</p> -->
<!-- 
      <p><strong>Registering a non-school venue</strong><br>
      If you want to set up a Code Club in non-school venue, such as a library or a youth centre, then simply select &#39;Public Venue&#39; in the drop-down menu. Finding a volunteer and setting up the club works in exactly the same way. However, you&#39;ll need parental permission for each child taking part. Your volunteer will be given an email link to send out to parents.</p> -->

    <hr />

      <h3 id="for-parents">For Parents</h3>

      <p>Full information for parents can be found <a href="../start-a-club/parents/parents.htm">here</a>.</p>

      <p><strong>Is Code Club safe?</strong><br>
      All Code Club volunteers must be approved by the school and venue they will be teching at. If a volunteer in a school is not a teacher, we also request that teacher from the school is present at all lessons.</p>

      <p><strong>Is there a club near me?</strong><br>
      Search the map on our <a href="../index.html#map">homepage</a>.</p>.
      <p>The best plan for your child would be to set one up at their school if one does not already exist. That way, they can learn with their friends and with a teacher that they already know. We've put together some materials to help you when you go and speak their head teacher which you can find <a href="../start-a-club/parents/parents.htm">here</a>. You can also register your interest to have a club started at your childs school by clicking <a href="../start-a-club/parents/parents.htm">"propose a club"</a>.</p>

      <p><strong>My child's school doesn't run a club. Can they join another?</strong><br>
      If your child's school isn't interested in running Code Club, then it could be there's a club running at public venue such as a library nearby. Searching on the map on our <a href="../index.html#map">homepage</a> should inform you of any public clubs nearby. You can also <a href="../contact/contact-us.htm">propose to start a new club</a>.</p>

      <p><strong>Can my child join a club at another school?</strong><br>
      There&#39;s certainly no reason from our point of view that this couldn&#39;t be arranged, but it&#39;s entirely down to the school in question, and the volunteer who runs the session. The best way to find out would be to contact them directly and ask.</p>

      <p><strong>Can my younger children join?</strong><br>
      Our material is written for primary school level, and involves quite a lot of reading and maths in some places. There&#39;s some example projects <a href="../codeclub/about.htm">here</a>, to give you an idea. Unfortunately, we recommend that unless one-to-one tutoring is available, the lesson would be too hard for children under 9.</p>
